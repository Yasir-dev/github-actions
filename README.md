# GitHub Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy a simple website to GitHub Pages.

## Features

- Simple HTML page
- Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
- GitHub Actions workflow

## How it works

Whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch, especially to the `index.html` file, a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered. This workflow builds and deploys the website to GitHub Pages.
